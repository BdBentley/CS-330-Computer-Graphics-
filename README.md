   ##How do I approach designing software?
    I approach designing software with a troubleshooting process in mind. I start by reading documentation and then immeditaley start experimenting with the different technologies used in the project.
    
        **What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
        It has certainly helped with my ability to look up different solutions to complex problems. It has also expanded my understanding of OpenGL and GLEW
        
        **What design process did you follow for your project work?**
        It was an iterative design process that built over the course of the class. It started simple with just creating the build environment and ended
        with creating an actual scene of an image we orignally took
        
        **How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
        Certainly it will be used to further develop other software in the future. Using an iterative process with great Change Management techniques will help
        to develop useful, readable, maintainable software.
        
        **How did iteration factor into your development?**
        By slowly building on the project over time it helped to understand different portions of the software and different modules that would come together 
        for the final project. It is easier to take things in bite sized portions instead of immediately drinking from the firehouse.
        
        **How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
        I would work with the tutorial code, read documentation, develop iteratively, and test my software constantly. The approach remained relatively the same
        throughout this work. It only changed towards the end where I had to build the project separately from the tutorial code.
      
        **How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational/professional
        pathway?**
        Computational graphics and visualizations have many uses in the Computer Science field beyond the typical usage in video games. We need graphics for 
        scientific processes as well as simulations. This will help in my educational pathway by helping me understand more complex languages and development           processes
